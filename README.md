# Face-swapping-in-video-using-OpenCV
A Python OpenCV application to apply face swapping in videos. Select a source image and a destination video and you can get an output file after face swapping along with audio.
Has basic Delaunay's triangulation and warping the triangles formed. But what makes difference from other programs is that it saves the output and it can be given a destination video instead of webcam and the audio will also be included in the output file produced.
Code has been clearly explained in the comments.
